ContextAPI :-
We can use contextApi fo avoiding prop drilling. It is basically a global variable

1). createContext (import) ==> First create a file where u want to store context then export your context to default. and then create context.Also put default value whatever u wanna pass in prop, Its better if you use name of file and context variable same.
syntax = const ThemeContext = createContext("light-mode")

2). In your App.js or any other file use useContext (import) to get the data from that context file you had created. You need to import that file to for accessing that data.
syntax = const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)

3). If you want to change value inside the context use .Provider method and value attribute to change it.
example --> 
	<ThemeContext.Provider value={yourvalue}>
		...code
	</ThemeContext.Provider>

This ThemeContext.Provider value will overwrite the context value but use this provider method in top level of ypur app, Its not necessary but ih has its own scope.

Check App.js, ThemeContext.js and AddVideo.js for better understanding
