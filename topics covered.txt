useState Hook :-
we can change the internal variable in javascript using their functionality. but we cannot directly update UI in react so, we use useState hook to change the UI. because whenever the component change It re-renders and state is able to store data inside it.

Whenever we change a state or props. Then those component which is have the changed state or prop will re-renders.

See Count.js for example
