useRef Hook :- 
It stores the reference of the variable or html DOM element. We can store and access it using hookname.current property which is prefined

useRef hook can store data after the component re render. But unlike useState , updating useRef wont re-render components

the syntax is pretty simple 

const variable = useRef(someValue) // or u can give it to null if u want
variable.current // For accessing value

As for the DOM referemce 
const variable = useRef(null)

useEffect(() = > {
	variable.current.focus()
}, [])

render(
	<input type = "text" ref={variable} />  // ref is a prop which needs to be defined if you want to access dom reference on some element
)
